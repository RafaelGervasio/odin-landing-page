This is my second project from The Odin Project

I've appliedÂ a lot of the things I learned from HTML & CSS.

I'm really happy with this one.
It's the first project I build that's actually good looking.

I didin't commit as much as I should have. I'll try to improve on that next time.


Overall, good job.
